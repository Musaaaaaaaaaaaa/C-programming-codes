# 💻 C Programming Projects and Exercises

This repository contains my collection of **C programming codes** developed during coursework and practice sessions.  
Each program demonstrates fundamental and intermediate-level programming concepts — from basic syntax and loops to complex data structures and file handling.

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- **Basic Syntax & I/O** — Variables, data types, input/output, operators.  
- **Control Structures** — Conditionals, loops, switch-case, nested logic.  
- **Functions & Recursion** — Modular programming and problem decomposition.  
- **Arrays & Pointers** — Memory management and data manipulation.  
- **Structures & Unions** — Organizing related data efficiently.  
- **File Handling** — Reading, writing, and managing data persistence.  
- **Data Structures** — Implementations of stacks, queues, and linked lists.
